# Word-embedding

I performed word embeddings using Glove on the document 'UIC' and created a scatter plot to see the clusters of the projections. 

Insights from the Scatterplot of projections: 
Since, my model did not train itself, the context is not learned. Hence, the scatterplot seems to not have right clusters.
